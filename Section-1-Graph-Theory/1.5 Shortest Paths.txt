1.5 - Shortest Path Problems

Shortest path problems mainly fall into two categories: single-source,
or all-pairs. Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford’s algorithms can be used to
solve the former while the Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be used to solve
the latter. BFS is a special case of Dijkstra's algorithm where the
priority queue becomes a FIFO queue on unweighted graphs. Dijkstra's
algorithm is a special case of A* search, where the heuristic is zero.
The all-pairs shortest path on sparse graphs is best computed with
Johnson’s algorithm (a combination of Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra’s).
However, Johnson’s algorithm and A* search are both rare in contests,
and thus are ommitted.

Implementation note for the section:

Infinity is arbitrarily defined as 2^28 = 268,435,456. Defining it closer
to INT_MAX (2,147,483,647) will cause overflow errors during intermediate
steps of the algorithms where addition with infinity may be performed.
