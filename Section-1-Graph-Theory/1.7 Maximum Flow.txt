1.7 - Maximum Flow

Description: Given a flow network, find a flow from a
single-source node to a single sink node that is maximized.


Max-flow Min-cut Theorem:
The max-flow min-cut thorem states that in a flow network,
the maximum amount of flow passing from the source to the
sink is equal to the minimum capacity that, when removed
in a specific way from the network, causes the situation
that no flow can pass from the source to the sink.

Max-flow Min-cut Example:
The figure below is a network with a max-flow of 7. We want
to block off all flow from the source node s, to the sink
node t by removing a subset of the graphâ€™s edges, while
minimizing the total capacity of the edges that are removed.
The best way to do this is by removing the edges s-->1 and
s-->2, which has a total capacity of 4 + 3 = 7, the same
value as the maxflow. Another way to block off the flow from
s to t is by removing the edges 1-->t and 2-->t. However the
capacity removed would be 4 + 5 = 9, and this is not optimal.
