1.6 - Minimum Spanning Trees

Given an undirected graph, its minimum spanning tree (MST) is a tree connecting
all nodes with a subset of its edges such that their total weight is minimized.
Both Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms use a greedy algorithm to find the solution. 
Prim’s algorithm requires a graph to be connected. Kruskal’s algorithm uses a
disjoint-set data structure, and will find the minimum spanning forest if the
graph is not connected, thus making it more versatile than Prim’s.

Though a Fibonacci Heap would make Prim’s faster than Kruskal’s, it is infeasible
to implement during contests. Using a linear sorting algorithm like radix sort or
bucket sort alongside a disjoint-set data structure that uses union by rank and
path compression, Kruskal’s can be optimized to run in O(E*a(V)), where a is
the extremely slow growing inverse of the Ackermann function (see section 3.1
for an implementation of disjoint-set forests).
