Section 1 - Graph Theory

Section Notes: Some programs in this section internally operate on
1-based vertices, and others 0-based. However, all of the example inputs
are 1-based. You can assume that the algorithm operates on 0-based
labelling if nodes are immediately decremented when they’re inputted
(e.g. “cin >> a >> b;   a--; b--;”). It is your job to be cautious
with shifting indices, as well as properly initializing arrays when
readapting these programs for specific problems.
