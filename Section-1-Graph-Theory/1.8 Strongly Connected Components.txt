Section 1.8 - Strongly Connected Components

Given a directed graph, its strongly connected components (SCC)
are its maximal strongly connected sub-graphs. A graph is strongly
connected if there is a path from each node to every other node.
Condensing the strongly connected components of a graph into
single nodes will result in a directed acyclic graph.
