1.4.2 - Cycle Detection (Brent's Algorithm)

For a function f which maps a finite set S to itself and any
initial value x0 in S, the sequence of iterated values:

x_0, x_1 = f(x_0), x_2 = f(x_1), ... x_i = f(x_(i-1))

must eventually use the same value twice: there must be some
i <> j such that xi = xj. Once this happens, the sequence
must continue periodically, by repeating the same sequence
of values from x_i to x_(jâˆ’1). Cycle detection asks to find
i and j, given the function f(x) and x_0.

Brent's cycle-finding algorithm is based on a different idea
than Floyd's: searching for the smallest power of two, 2^i
that is larger than both lambda and mu.

Time Complexity: O(lambda + mu), where lambda is the length
of the cycle and mu is the first index of x for which the
cycle starts to occur. Brent claims that, on average, his
cycle finding algorithm runs around 36% more quickly than
Floyd's and that it speeds up the Pollard rho algorithm by
around 24% (see mathematics chapter).

Space Complexity: O(1) auxiliary.
